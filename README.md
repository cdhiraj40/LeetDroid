LeetDroid is an android client for LeetCode. It has mostly all the features that are provided from leetcode that allow
you to see all the questions (around 1000+) along with their solutions, discussion for every question. It also includes
general discussions, currently has discussions for ``interview experience``, daily new questions to solve, that are same
from leetcode's daily challenges, contest timer and notification to remind coders, and leetcode profile in the app itself to
check ranks, acceptance rates, contest history along with every contest ranks and ratings and recent submissions too. It
also provides random questions after every ask from the user.The app will be having more features that are
mentioned [here](https://github.com/cdhiraj40/LeetDroid/blob/main/README.md#future-scope)
To use LeetDroid, You will need just an account of LeetDroid that you can create in app.
<br/>Currently app supports for only leetcode users, app fetches data on user's username. In future this might change.

## Download
first release is out! Download from [here](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.cdhiraj40.leetdroid)

## Why it was made:

The idea came when I consecutively forgot about contests happening at leetcode, and I could not find any app that was
sending notifications for contest a day before. That's when I started researching, and then I made LeetDroid which does
not only have notifications but your whole LeetCode profile in your pockets.

## What it does :

This project "LeetDroid" proposes ‚Äúone-stop for all leetcode read-only work in android‚Äù to keep track of all your
leetcode activities, upcoming contests, question lists including their solution and discussions. A user has to never
miss out any contests from now on, the app gives notifications 1 day and 30 minutes prior a contest. The app also shows
Leetcode daily challenges that gets updated every day at 5.30 AM with respect to your android time. Apart from all this
LeetDroid gives info about your whole leetcode profile right in your pocket with information from contests history to
recent submissions, rankings to no of problems solved and acceptance rate. We all get bored after searching for a
perfect question to practice, LeetDroid can also give you any random question from the list :)
