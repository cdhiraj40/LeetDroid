LeetDroid is an Android client for LeetCode. It has most of the features that are provided in LeetCode that allow
you to see all the questions (around 1000+) along with their solutions, and discussion for every question. It also includes the following:

- General discussions for `interview experience`.
- New questions to solve daily that are from LeetCode's daily challenges.
- Contest timer and notifications to remind you to solve challenges.
- Your LeetCode profile is also integrated into the app enabling you to
view ranks, acceptance rates, contest history, ratings, and recent submissions too.
- It also provides random questions after every task from the user.

More features will be included in the app as
mentioned [here](https://github.com/cdhiraj40/LeetDroid/blob/main/README.md#future-scope)

> **Note**: You will need a LeetCode account to use LeetDroid. You can create a LeetCode account within LeetDroid.
<br>
Currently, the app supports only LeetCode users, it fetches data through a user's LeetCode profile. This might change in the future.

## Download

The first release of LeetDroid is out! Download it from [here](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.cdhiraj40.leetdroid). Test it out and give us feedback if you find any bugs or if you need help.

## Why it was made

The idea came when I consecutively forgot about contests happening at LeetCode, and I could not find any app that was
sending notifications for a contest a day before. That's when I started researching, and then I made LeetDroid which does
not only have notifications but your whole LeetCode profile in your pocket.

## What it does

This project "LeetDroid" proposes a ‚Äúone-stop for all LeetCode read-only work on Android‚Äù to keep track of all your
LeetCode activities, upcoming contests, and question lists (including their solution and discussions). Now you never have to worry about missing out on any contests from now on, the app will provide you with notifications 1 day and 30 minutes before a contest.

The app also shows daily LeetCode challenges that get updated every day at 5.30 AM with respect to your device's timezone. Furthermore,
LeetDroid provides info about your LeetCode profile right in your pocket with information from contest history to
recent submissions, rankings to no. of problems solved, and acceptance rate. We all get bored after searching for a
perfect question to practice, LeetDroid can also suggest random questions for you to practice :happy:
